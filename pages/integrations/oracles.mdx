# Oracles

## Chronicle 
The first Oracle on Ethereum, [Chronicle Protocol](https://chroniclelabs.org/)'s decentralized Oracle network was originally built within MakerDAO for the development of DAI and is now available to builders on Superseed.

   **Data Feeds**: Builders can choose from 65+ data feeds, including crypto assets, yield rates, and RWAs. Chronicle's data is sourced via custom-built data models, only utilizing Tier 1 Primary Sources, such as the markets where tokens are actively traded, including Coinbase, Binance, Uniswap, and Curve.
  
    
   **Transparency & Integrity**: Chronicle's Oracle network is fully transparent and verifiable. Via [The Chronicle](https://chroniclelabs.org/dashboard/oracle/ETH/USD?blockchain=ETH&txn=0x45b5c5819eb3804db9aaca190eea80588d87709d90f5eafc0a8cc4e6c6c54dda&contract=0x46ef0071b1E2fF6B42d36e5A177EA43Ae5917f4E), the data supply chain for any Oracle can be viewed in real-time and historically, including data sources and the identity of all Validators/Signers. Users can cryptographically challenge the integrity of every Oracle update using the 'verify' feature. Data is independently sourced by a community of Validators, including Gitcoin, Etherscan, Infura, DeFi Saver, MakerDAO, and more.

   **Gas Efficiency**: Pioneering the Schnorr-based Oracle architecture, Chronicle's Oracles use 60-80% less gas per update than other Oracle providers. This lowest cost per update allows Push Oracle updates to be made more regularly, ensuring more accurate and granular data reporting.

Every Oracle implementation is customized to fit your needs. Implement one of the existing data models or contact the Chronicle team via [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/CjgvJ9EspJ) to develop a custom Oracle data feed.

Developers can dive deeper into Chronicle Protocol's architecture and unique design choices via the **[docs](https://docs.chroniclelabs.org/Developers/tutorials/Remix)**.
